    "- General Information\n",
    "    - The cherry plantation crop from Farmy & Foods is facing a challenge where their cherry plantations have been presenting powdery mildew. Currently, the process is manual verification if a given cherry tree contains powdery mildew. An employee spends around 30 minutes in each tree, taking a few samples of tree leaves and verifying visually if the leaf tree is healthy or has powdery mildew. If there is powdery mildew, the employee applies a specific compound to kill the fungus. The time spent applying this compound is 1 minute. The company has thousands of cherry trees located on multiple farms across the country. As a result, this manual process is not scalable due to the time spent in the manual process inspection.\n",
    "- Project Dataset\n",
    "    - The available dataset contains 4208 labelled images of cherry leaves, divided evenly (2104 each) between healthy leaves and leaves affected by mildew.\n",
    "- Business Requirements\n",
    "    - The client is interested in conducting a study to visually differentiate a cherry leaf that is healthy from one that contains powdery mildew.\n",
    "    - The client is interested in predicting if a cherry leaf is healthy or contains powdery mildew."
